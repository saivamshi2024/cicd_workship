# 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Project – Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment

This repository demonstrates a **CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)** pipeline setup to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying a software or ML application. It ensures that every code change is automatically validated and delivered to production with minimal manual intervention.

---

## 🚀 What is CI/CD?

- **CI (Continuous Integration):** Automatically integrates code changes, runs unit tests, and ensures code quality on every push.
- **CD (Continuous Deployment):** Automatically delivers the integrated code to production or staging environments after passing tests.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ Automate code testing on every commit
- ✅ Automatically deploy changes to production or staging
- ✅ Use version control (GitHub) as the single source of truth
- ✅ Ensure reliability, reproducibility, and faster delivery

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

| Tool              | Purpose                              |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Git & GitHub**  | Source code management               |
| **GitHub Actions / Jenkins** | CI/CD pipeline orchestration |
| **Docker**        | Containerization (optional)          |
| **Python / NodeJS / etc.** | Application language        |
| **pytest / unittest** | Testing framework                |
| **Streamlit / Flask / React** | Frontend or backend app   |

## 🧪 Pipeline Workflow

1. **Code Push**: Developer pushes code to GitHub
2. **CI Triggered**: Pipeline starts automatically
3. **Test Stage**: Unit tests are run (e.g., with `pytest`)
4. **Build Stage**: Application is built (e.g., with Docker)
5. **Deploy Stage**: Code is deployed to production or staging

## ✅ Key Benefits
- Automated Testing 🧪
- Faster Release Cycles ⚡
- Reduced Human Error 🔐
- Reproducible Deployments 🔁
- Easy Rollback Capability 🔙

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Integrate Docker and Kubernetes
- Add Slack or email notifications
- Include SonarQube for code quality analysis
- Set up a staging environment before full deployment
